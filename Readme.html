<p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'>MORE THAN A README, THIS IS SOME KIND OF FAQ...</span></b></p><br>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>GAME RULES 
  FOR NIM:</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>         Take 
  the number of pieces you desire from any column and the computer also does the 
  same. The one who takes the last piece is the winner!!! Very easy.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>OTHER GAMES 
  ARE JUST SIMPLE SHOOTERS... EXCEPT FOR THE ORIGINAL PREDECESSOR OF ARKANOID!</span></b></p><br>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'>* WHAT THE HELL IS A ZX SPECTRUM?</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A ZX Spectrum 
  is the most powerful computer ever created... just kidding. The ZX Spectrum was 
  introduced in 1982-83 and it was the first computer specially oriented to the 
  home user due to the low price it had. But... what was inside the case?</span></p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>8-bit ZILOG 
    Z80 processor running at 3 MHz (it was compatible with the Intel’s 8080 processor 
    in terms of registers and instruction set, but the Z80 instruction set was 
    an extension of it). This processor was later used in LOTS of arcade games; 
    even arcades of 1991 like Street Fighter 2 still used this chip!</span></li>
  <li><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>32K of RAM: 
    16K were used for the ROM and the remaining 16K used as standard RAM.</span></li>
  <li><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>3-bit color 
    palette that had two tones, one opaque and one bright that made an amazing 
    total of 16 colors (so it was really a 4-bit color palette).</span></li>
  <li><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>A built in 
    Basic interpreter, that is really the base of Visual Basic. The name says 
    it all: now it is Visual, but the coding standards are almost the same.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Then in 1985 
  the ZX Spectrum + was introduced to the market. It featured the new Z80 A processor 
  that was something like a Pentium 4A... it corrected most of the deficiencies 
  of the previous processor and they pumped-up the speed to 3.5 MHz. This new 
  model also featured a total of 64K in RAM (16+48) that allowed bigger and better 
  programs and an extended keyboard with a few more keys. Later in 1985, the Spectrum 
  128K was presented in a technology expo but I do not remember when it was launched 
  to the market nor if it had the success of its predecessors...</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'>* WHAT THE ZX-BASIC MODULE DOES?</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Ok, before telling 
  you what it does, I will tell you what it does not do:</span></p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It is not 
    a code interpreter, so I am not interpreting the old Spectrum Basic code, 
    just adapting it to work in VB.</span></li>
  <li><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So it isn’t 
    either an emulator of anything...</span></li>
  <li><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Almost complete 
    ZX spectrum emulation including User Definable Graphics support (UDG)</span></li>
  <li><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>We can’t use 
    machine code, since it is only specific for the ZX Spectrum... but as today 
    computers are million times faster we can translate the Z80 machine code to 
    x86 machine code ;) </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'>And... what it does then?</span></b></p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It allows 
    you to port a ZX Spectrum application to VB if you have the Basic code... but 
    with the limitations previously exposed.</span></li>
  <li><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>It opens a 
    new world of options (or and old one?) for the developers that, like me, are 
    pleased to see the things working well... </span></li>
  <li><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>You can easily 
    develop simple games like this ones... but just for fun and knowledge... it is 
    very difficult to make any thing in plain Basic once we learned the good VB 
    and have our own vices that can’t be done in old Basic...</span></li>
  <li><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Well... how 
    many of you out there didn’t know the existence of the GoSub keyword??? I 
    bet lots of you, in fact, no one uses it actually... but it is a very useful 
    one!</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'>* SO, WHY DID YOU DO THIS PIECE OF CRAP?</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Simple: I got 
  my first Spectrum when I was 3 years old... well I was still a “baby” to use it 
  so my sister was the one that used it the most... this was about 1986. 4 years 
  later I was converted into a Spectrum addict, I used to play with it a lot and 
  it not lasted much time until I felt the curiosity to program my own games. 
  Ok, I was still a kid, but I could read and press keys with no problem... so my 
  father bought me some magazines about the ZX Spectrum... one of them was the “RUN” 
  magazine that was really a book that had 3 tomes but it came separately each 
  week one fascicle. I did a lot of the programs contained there, and saved them 
  in cassettes... yes, those massive storage units could have up to 640 Kb of information 
  if used a 60 minutes cassette...</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>And with the 
  time, approximately in 1996, I finally realized it became a bit old. Not obsolete, 
  because most of the games I had (about 220 titles) looked better in my TV than 
  a simple DOS game running in a monochromatic monitor... even some Win 3.1 and 
  some Win 95 games were rubbish compared to the good “Booty”, “Gremlins”, “GFTG”, 
  “Rygar”, “Out Run” (yes, the same from the arcades), and other great games I 
  don’t remember right now... and also the LOGO program was better than the DOS 
  based one or the late MS version that was a complete piece of crap...</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>So... why? Nostalgia 
  may be, or just to teach myself some new things, or may be because there is 
  actually no NIM for PC... or other games I will port in the future...</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'>* WHY DID YOU USE LINE NUMBERS, AND A VERY UNOPTIMIZED CODE?</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Because I wanted 
  to show you how easy is to take the original code and with a few changes it 
  is ready to run under VB... Obviously, variables must be declared and the Variant 
  type must be avoided. Also all these GoTo and GoSub statements are terrible 
  for the good structured programming, but this is the way old Basic programs 
  were used to be written, and this is what I want to show you. Please never try 
  to write such messy code unless you want to make it very cryptic and almost 
  unreadable!!! And, why I used P-Code to compile it? It’s because I wanted to 
  have the feeling I am running interpreted code, just as the Spectrum did...</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Verdana'>* WHAT I SHOULD DO TO PORT A BASIC PROGRAM LIKE YOU DID?</span></b></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>First of all, 
  you have to be sure your program does not use Machine Code and the other things 
  stated before... Second thing, just copy the program as you have it, and remember 
  to replace some of the functions as I did because they overlap with new VB functions 
  that do different things...<br>And as you may have noticed, the modules are almost completely self contained, they just depend on the ZXBasic module to work... so adding or deleting a game is very easy!</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Old Function                      |

  avoid to replace or change...</span></p>
<p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana'>Finally, if you 
  port any app to VB please let me know.</span></p>
